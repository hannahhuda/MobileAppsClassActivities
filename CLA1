Class Activity - Dart Building Blocks
Given the following readLineSync() function (from dart:io library) to read input from the command line or terminal:

import 'dart:io';

void main() {

  stdout.write("Input:");

  var input = stdin.readLineSync();

  stdout.write(input + "\n");

}

1. You are required to get the input from user. The input can be any size (unlimited values) but only with integer and double data type. For example:

Input: 21, 23, 12, 45, 39, 40

Input: 2.2, 45, 3.6, 6.6, 70

2. Then split the input into a list by using .split() function. You can refer to Dart API on split function for more details on implementation. Once you have the list, perform mathematical operation on the values. For example:

Input: 21, 23, 12, 45, 39, 40

Summation: 180

Average: 30

Division: 0.00000108

Subtraction: -138

Multiplication: 406879200
